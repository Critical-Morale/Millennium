#Millennium - now with 100% less typos in the title!

Welcome to the cutting-edge branch of Millennium! If you'd like to take a look at something more usable, switch to the *Legacy* branch. However, note that the *Legacy* branch of the project is basically a pile of trash held together by metaphorical duct tape. Use at your own risk.

*Millennium* is a project dedictated to recreating the gameplay of the Paper Mario game series. The focus of this project lies on replication of mechanics found in *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door*, which was developed by Intelligent Systems and released on the *Nintendo GameCube* in 2004. The goal of *Millennium* is to give the community a more flexible alternative to Paper Mario hacking tools when making a game based on Paper Mario.

*Millennium* is using the *Unity* Engine and is written in C#, so some coding experience is recommended, though this will not be a requirement forever. More updates to follow once most of the gameplay is in place. A recent graphics card is also recommended as this project is using the *Unity High Definition Render Pipeline* to enable a graphical fidelity far beyond what the GameCube could render.

As all of this is still in a very early state in development, I currently DO NOT recommend using this to make a game. Breaking changes may and will occur at any time!

To contribute to *Millennium*, fork this repo and clone your fork to your computer. Next, open the Unity Hub, press the *Add* button, navigate to the *Millennium* folder you just cloned to your computer and select the folder. As of March 12th 2019, Unity 2019.1.0f1 or newer is required to open the project.

A playable demo will be added to this page later. However, a precompiled binary is available for download on the main page of the *Legacy* branch if you re√°lly want to check it out!
